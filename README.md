bulk-svgtoeagle
===============

Online converter for simple SVG files from Inkscape to Eagle CAD. Based on the work by [Gorodon Williams](https://github.com/gfwilliams/svgtoeagle).

I have moddified his code to support bulk file selection and conversion. I also removed the GUI elements of the webpage as the obstructed these moddifications.

Usage
-----
Files must have folowing format:
```
filename.layer.svg
```
The layer defined in the filename will define the eagle layer of the script.
